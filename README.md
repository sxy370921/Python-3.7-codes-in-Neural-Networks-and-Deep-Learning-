# **simple Neural Networks based on numpy**

This is  the code of python3.7 rewritten according to the code of python2 in the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" which written by Michael Nielsen. 

This code is of great significance to understand the principles of neural network and back propagation. This neural network uses only numpy to realize all the functions of the all connected neural network without any framework.

The task of realization is digital handwriting recognition.

这是根据Michael Nielsen写的Neural Networks and Deep Learning一书中的python2的numpy实现全连接神经网络实现的基于python3的相关代码。

此代码对理解神经网络原理、反向传播原理具有重要意义。该神经网络不借助任何框架，仅仅使用numpy实现全连接神经网络的全部功能。

实现的任务是数字手写辨识。
